abstract = {Face mask detection had seen significant progress in the domains of Image processing and Computer vision, since the rise of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been created using several algorithms and techniques. The proposed approach in this paper uses deep learning, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to detect face masks. This model can be used for safety purposes since it is very resource efficient to deploy. The SSDMNV2 approach uses Single Shot Multibox Detector as a face detector and MobilenetV2 architecture as a framework for the classifier, which is very lightweight and can even be used in embedded devices (like NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Raspberry pi) to perform real-time mask detection. The technique deployed in this paper gives us an accuracy score of 0.9264 and an F1 score of 0.93. The dataset provided in this paper, was collected from various sources, can be used by other researchers for further advanced models such as those of face recognition, facial landmarks, and facial part detection process.},

@article{Ramos2018,
abstract = {In this work, we analyze the cross-entropy function, widely used in classifiers both as a performance measure and as an optimization objective. We contextualize cross-entropy in the light of Bayesian decision theory, the formal probabilistic framework for making decisions, and we thoroughly analyze its motivation, meaning and interpretation from an information-theoretical point of view. In this sense, this article presents several contributions: First, we explicitly analyze the contribution to cross-entropy of (i) prior knowledge; and (ii) the value of the features in the form of a likelihood ratio. Second, we introduce a decomposition of cross-entropy into two components: discrimination and calibration. This decomposition enables the measurement of different performance aspects of a classifier in a more precise way; and justifies previously reported strategies to obtain reliable probabilities by means of the calibration of the output of a discriminating classifier. Third, we give different information-theoretical interpretations of cross-entropy, which can be useful in different application scenarios, and which are related to the concept of reference probabilities. Fourth, we present an analysis tool, the Empirical Cross-Entropy (ECE) plot, a compact representation of cross-entropy and its aforementioned decomposition. We show the power of ECE plots, as compared to other classical performance representations, in two diverse experimental examples: a speaker verification system, and a forensic case where some glass findings are present.},

While the second component is designed for the classification process of face masks using decision trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and ensemble algorithm. Three face masked datasets have been selected for investigation. The Three datasets are the Real-World Masked Face Dataset (RMFD), the Simulated Masked Face Dataset (SMFD), and the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW). The SVM classifier achieved 99.64{\%} testing accuracy in RMFD. In SMFD, it achieved 99.49{\%}, while in LFW, it achieved 100{\%} testing accuracy.},

abstract = {This paper discussed about a unique neural network approach stimulated by a technique that has reformed the field of computer vision: pixel-wise image classification, which we combine with binary cross entropy loss and pre training of the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) as an auto encoder. The pixel-wise classification technique directly estimates the image source label for each time-frequency (T-F) bin in our image, thus eliminating common pre-and-post processing tasks. The proposed convolutional neural network is trained by using the binary mask as the target output label. The binary mask identifies the dominant image source in each T-F bin of the magnitude spectrogram of a mixture signal, by considering each T-F bin as a pixel with a multi-label (for each image source). Binary Cross Entropy is used as the training objective, so as to minimize the average probability error between the target and predicted label for each pixel. The Inception V3 architecture is used to further boost ImageNet classification accuracy. The results show that the proposed algorithm has the highest accuracy.},

Recent object detection which is based on deep learning models has achieved promising results concerning the finding of an object in images.

Wearing a medical face mask in public areas, protect people from COVID-19 transmission among them. The proposed model consists of two components. The first component is designed for the feature extraction process based on the ResNet-50 deep transfer learning model. While the second component is designed for the detection of medical face masks based on YOLO v2. Two medical face masks datasets have been combined in one dataset to be investigated through this research. To improve the object detection process, mean IoU has been used to estimate the best number of anchor boxes. The achieved results concluded that the adam optimizer achieved the highest average precision percentage of 81{\%} as a detector. Finally, a comparative result with related work has been presented at the end of the research. The proposed detector achieved higher accuracy and precision than the related work.},

COVID-19 is an infectious disease and almost leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, the virus epidemic is a big problem for humanity healthy and can lead die in special people with background diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, chronic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and kidney failure. Different medical, social, and engineering methods have been proposed to face the disease include treatment, detection, prevention, and prediction approaches. Methods: We propose a taxonomy tree to investigate the disease confronting methods and their negative and positive effects. Our work consists of a case study and systematic literature review (SLR) to evaluate the proposed methods against the virus outbreak and disease epidemic. Results: Our experimental results and observations demonstrate the impact of the proposed medical, prevention, detection, prediction, and social methods for facing the spread of COVID-19 from December 2019 to July 2020. Conclusion: Our case study can help people have more information about the disease and its impact on humanity healthy and illustrate effective self-caring methods and therapies.},

Due to COVID-19's spread in 212 countries and territories and increasing numbers of infected cases and death tolls mounting to 5,212,172 and 334,915 (as of May 22 2020), it remains a real threat to the public health system. This paper renders a response to combat the virus through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some Deep Learning (DL) methods have been illustrated to reach this goal, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM). It delineates an integrated bioinformatics approach in which different aspects of information from a continuum of structured and unstructured data sources are put together to form the user-friendly platforms for physicians and researchers. The main advantage of these AI-based platforms is to accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 disease. The most recent related publications and medical reports were investigated with the purpose of choosing inputs and targets of the network that could facilitate reaching a reliable Artificial Neural Network-based tool for challenges associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, there are some specific inputs for each platform, including various forms of the data, such as clinical data and medical imaging which can improve the performance of the introduced approaches toward the best responses in practical applications.},
